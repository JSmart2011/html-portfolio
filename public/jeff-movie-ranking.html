<h1>The Best Movies According to Jeff</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Horror Films of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Strangers</h3>
<p>This film made me fall in love with the subgenre of home invasion films. There were multiple reasons to love this film from the creepy narrator at the opening of the film seemingly inspired by Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to the tactful jumpscares to the true story element no matter how accurate. </p>
<h3>Scream</h3>
<p>If you were a 90s kid like myself, you probably had the honor of watching Wes Craven's masterpiece Scream. This film had a beautiful yet terrifying opening with Drew Barrymore, who was probably the most notable actress on this film and the amazing twist that she dies 10 minutes into the movie. The film was so successful that it now has 6 entries into the franchise with rumors of a 7th in the works. We were all lucky enough to experience the rise of a new famous serial killer, Ghostface.</p>
<h3>Psycho</h3>
<p>Whether or not this film should be third in my list is up for debate because this was a classic. If someone says Alfred Hitchcock, this is the film almost everyone remembers immediately. While I gave Scream credit for the twist of killing off whom we as the audience thought was the protagonist  early in the film, this was the film that did it first. Because of this film, audiences around the world had a reason to be afraid to take a shower. To me, this is the best black and white horror film I've ever seen and the reason I love Hitchcock films.</p>
